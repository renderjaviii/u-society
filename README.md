# USociety - REST Manager
REST API Orchestrator created for the USociety project.

This RESTful micro service has the function of the Resource server, so, if itâ€™s the head of all the ecosystem (the orchestrator).\
There are a certain group of public endpoints (no requires authentication) and other privates; then if you receive a 401 (Unauthorized HTTP code) as status response, you first need to get the authorization token and add it to the `Authorization` request header.

#### Change list
- _2021-07-20: "Improvements"._ 
- _2021-07-18: General refactor._
- _2020-08-15: Project initialization._

#### How to run locally

1. Recreate database locally - MySQL: `docker-compose -f src/main/resources/docker-db.yml up --build`
2. Recreate in-memory store (cache) locally - Redis: `docker-compose -f src/main/resources/docker-cache.yml up --build` 
3. Compile Spring project and generate jar file: `mvn clean install`
4. Build docker image: `docker build -t u-society/manager .`.
5. Run docker container: `docker-compose up --build -d`
6. Show container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
7. Stop container: `docker-compose down -v`
8. Run and check tests coverage: `jacoco:report`
9. Clean Redis cache: `docker exec company-redis redis-cli flushall`

#### Notes
- Base API path: `https://localhost:8443/manager`
- Swagger documentation: `https://localhost:8443/manager/swagger-ui.html`.

#### Technologies used
- **Spring boot** (Open source microservice-based Java web framework)
- **Docker** (Used for package the application into containers)
- **Docker compose** (Tool for defining and running multi-container applications)
- **MVN** (Maven manager dependency, used to build and manage the entire project)
- **MySQL** (Relational database management system)
- **OAUTH2** (Open standard for access delegation)
- **JWT** (Java Web Tokens, open standard for creating signed and encrypted data)
- **Spring Security** (It provides the authentication and authorization mechanisms)
- **Webflux** (Reactive REST client used to interconnect all the micro services ecosystem)
- **Swagger UI** (Used to document and use the web service)
- **Model mapper** (Used to convert between Java objects and matching JSON structures)
- **Spring mail** (It provides the mail support)
- **Gmail SMTP** (Email provider used to send emails)
- **Apache tomcat** (Web server container)
- **Jackson databind** (High-performance JSON processor)
- **Apache commons lang3** (Reusable static utility methods)
- **JUnit 4 + Mockito** (Unit testing stuff)
- **JaCoCo** (Code coverage report generator)
- **Redis** (In-memory key-value data structure store)
- **Lettuce client** (Fully non-blocking Redis client)
- **Slugify** (Uniques identifying part address generator)

#### Additional considerations
1. If you want to change the general server configurations (like port), you can change the environment variables from this file `src/main/resources/development.env`.
2. When you run the docker db container, the database is going to be populated using the seeders files: `src/main/resources/data.sql` and `src/main/resources/import.sql` (If you want to avoid it remove the entry points localized in the .yaml file).
3. This API uses a self-signed SSL certificate, you could need to ignore the security warning in your API client (e.g. Postman) in order to be able to consume it.
